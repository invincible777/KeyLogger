# KeyLogger
A keylogger software to capture and record keystrokes on a computer for various purposes, such as monitoring user activity, enhancing security, or aiding in user research. The keylogger will run and log all keyboard inputs without disrupting normal system operation. It will store the collected data securely for later analysis or retrieval by authorized users.

> ## FEATURES

- **Dual Data Logging** : Unlike many existing keyloggers that log data in just one format, our solution logs keystrokes into both a JSON file and a text file simultaneously. This provides flexibility and ease of analysis for different user preferences.  

- **Customized GUI** : Our keylogger comes with a visually appealing and user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter. Users can easily interact with the application to start, pause, and stop keylogging as per their requirements.  

- **Intuitive Controls** : The keylogger's straightforward design allows users to manage keylogging effortlessly with intuitive start, pause, and stop controls. This simplicity enhances user experience and accessibility.  

- **Elegant Simplicity** : While many keyloggers might focus on complex functionalities, our solution stands out for its elegant simplicity. We prioritize essential features, making it easy to use and understand, even for non-technical users.  

- **User-Centric Approach** : The emphasis on ethical use, data security, and user consent sets our keylogger apart. We prioritize user privacy, ensuring responsible implementation and compliance with privacy regulations.  

- **Versatility** : The combination of dual data logging, customizable GUI, and intuitive controls makes our keylogger versatile, catering to different user needs, such as parental control, employee monitoring, research, and personal use.
